# Libraries

`core` - Essentially a support library

`format` - Header-only (? Once there are more complex things I'll figure out if this is a Good Idea or not) library with structures for all the data formats we read

`io` - Library for reading and writing game format data in a "abstracted" manner

`vfs` - BIG file VFS? if I hate myself probably
